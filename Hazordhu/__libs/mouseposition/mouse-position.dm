//   This file defines the client/MouseUpdate proc and the objects
//   needed to make it function. It works by creating two screen
//   objects, each having a faint checkerboard pattern on its icon.
//   The objects cover the entire screen, but as you move the mouse
//   and pass over cells of the checkerboards, the MouseEntered and
//   MouseExited events are called for the objects. This lets us
//   find the position of the mouse cursor with more precision than
//   usual.

		// This is the proc you call to start or stop tracking.
		// The parameters are:
		//
		//   track: either 0 or 1. 1 makes it start tracking, 0 makes it stop
		//   resolution: either 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16. How precise the tracking is
		//   layer: the layer of the objects used to track movement, this should
		//          be higher than any layer you use for any objects in your game
		track_mouse(track = 1, resolution = 4, layer = 1e4)

			if(track)

				// if you're already tracking mouse movements we don't need to do anything
